run c from root: cc src/interview.c && ./a.out

1. GCC - C programming compiler collection 
check gcc version: gcc --version
  Useful compile flags for learning:                                                                                                                                                     
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -g hello.c -o hello                                                                                                                                                  
  - -Wall -Wextra = show all warnings (helps catch mistakes)                                                                                                                             
  - -g = include debugging info 
c99 -Wall -o a.out  print.c -lm

2. Install gcc 
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install build-essential 

3. Run and compile c program
create the c file 
touch complete-c.c
compile the c

C is 
-a general-purpose programming language that gives you direct control over computer memory and hardware.
- It's compiled (converted to machine code before running), requires manual 
  memory management, and is used for operating systems, embedded systems,
   and real-time applications where performance and precise control matter.

C is a compiled language - which means that in order to run it, the compiler (for example, GCC or Visual Studio) 
must take the code that we wrote, process it, 
and then create an executable file. This file can then be executed, and will do what we intended for the program to do.

5. Run test files 
cc test/test_control_flow.c src/control-flow.c Unity/src/unity.c -I src/ -I Unity/src/ && ./a.out
